# ⭐️Overview

Just exploring the data that Griffin exported from SOPHAS. I'm not even sure what's in it at the moment. Eventually, we will want to use a better file structure. 


# 📦Load packages

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(meantables)
library(freqtables)
library(ggplot2)
```


# 📥Import data 

These are all people who have applied. Not all of them have been accepted (very few of them have).

Verified: Completed an application completely. If not verified, then they started an application, but may not have filled out anything.

```{r}
df <- readr::read_csv("data/Student Data Comma-Seperated Values.csv")
```

```{r}
dim(df) # 228 467
```


# 🚧Data management

For now, keep verified only.

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  filter(applicant_verified == "Yes")
```

```{r}
dim(df) # 140 467
```


## 🧮Recode/calculate variables

```{r}

```


# 📈Analysis

## Age

```{r}
mean_table(df, age_at_submission)
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(age_at_submission)) %>% 
  freq_table(age_at_submission) %>% 

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = cat, y = n), stat = "identity")
```



## Race and ethnicity

Hispanic

```{r}
# Skip pattern for type of hispanic origin
freq_table(df, race_hispanic)
```

```{r}
# Use this
freq_table(df, race_hispanic_yes_no_blank)
```

So, should blank be no?

Military status

```{r}
freq_table(df, military_status)
```

Race

```{r}
df %>% 
  select(cas_id, starts_with("race"))
```

We can make a combined variable later. For now, let's just see who considers themselves to be in each of the NIH race categories. 

https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-15-089.html

American Indian or Alaska Native

```{r}
freq_table(df, race_american_indian)
```

Asian

```{r}
freq_table(df, race_asian)
```

Black or African American

```{r}
freq_table(df, race_black)
```

Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander

```{r}
freq_table(df, race_pacific_islander)
```

White

```{r}
freq_table(df, race_white)
```

## Education

College name

Currently, this includes associates, bachelors, and graduate. There are variables we can use to filter though. 

```{r}
df %>% 
  select(cas_id, starts_with("college_name")) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = c(-cas_id),
    names_to = c(".value", "order"),
    names_prefix = "college_",
    names_sep = "_"
  ) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(name)) %>% 
  freq_table(name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There's lots of other interesting college stuff. I'm moving on for now to see what else there is.

## Address

Current country

```{r}
df %>% 
  freq_table(current_country_name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Among those in the United States, what state?

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(current_country_name == "United States") %>% 
  freq_table(current_state) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Among those in the United States, what postal code?

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(current_country_name == "United States") %>% 
  freq_table(current_postal_code) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Map it? Need lat and long for zips, I think.

```{r}
# df %>% 
#   filter(current_country_name == "United States") %>% 
#   freq_table(current_postal_code) %>% 
#   
# ggplot() +
#   geom_polygon(
#     data = map_data("state"), 
#     aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
#     color = 'gray', fill = NA, alpha = 0.35
#   ) +
#   geom_point(aes(color = n), size = .15, alpha = .25)
```

Among those in the Texas, what city?

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(current_state == "Texas") %>% 
  freq_table(current_county) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Among those in the Texas, what city?

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(current_state == "Texas") %>% 
  freq_table(current_city) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Permanent country

```{r}
df %>% 
  freq_table(permanent_country_name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(permanent_country_name == "United States") %>% 
  freq_table(permanent_state) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Among those in the United States, what postal code?

```{r}

  arrange(desc(n))
```

  filter(permanent_state == "Texas") %>% 
  freq_table(permanent_county) %>%

```
